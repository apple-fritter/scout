## Bloatware preempt
To preempt the installation of bloatware on a new or freshly reset device., you can follow these steps:

First, connect your device to your computer via USB cable and enable USB debugging mode in the device settings.

Open a command prompt or terminal window on your computer and type the following command to check if the device is connected properly:

```
adb devices
```

If the device is listed, then it is connected properly. If not, make sure USB debugging is enabled and that the correct drivers are installed for your device.

To disable the "android setup" process, use the following command:
```
adb shell pm disable-user --user 0 com.google.android.setupwizard
```

This will disable the setup wizard that runs when you first turn on the device.

To prevent bloatware from being installed on the device, you can use the following command:
```
adb shell pm disable-user --user 0 com.android.providers.downloads.ui
```

This will disable the download manager that is responsible for downloading and installing apps.
